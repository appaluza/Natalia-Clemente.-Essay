###	1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

>My first introduction into coding was an EDX course where I learned to make my very first game. It seemed to me as very logical, 
structured, and at the same time creative. 

>I enjoyed it a lot, but at that time I had a full time job that did not allow me to explore programming as much as I wanted. 
Later on I tried Codeacademy and Udemy studying HTML. That knowledge was incredibly useful when I was helping a friend of 
mine with her website. I noticed that although I was not an IT specialist I still needed minor knowledge of coding no matter 
what my profession would be in the future. For example, I was not able to set up Google Analytics just because I didn’t know Ruby. 
This was challenging and interesting. 

>I was born back that time, when there were no computers (am I that old?) and now I see modern kids having all kind 
of devices around them. 
It shows how high an impact of computers and the digital world make in our society.
I would like to become a professional in the IT field to make the future even more fascinating one.

###	2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

>For the next 2 years, I would like to get as much information as possible to improve my knowledge and skills in IT. 
I believe through education that I can receive at ADA academy will help me to get my foot into the world of IT and start working and gaining experience. 
>I am also planning on getting a degree as a Software Engineer.
>I enjoy supporting startup companies, so in 5 years I see myself as a leader of a project or as a teacher. 
I would like to create a course similar to ADA Academy in Southern California, because there are so many IT companies moving here and there is high demand for IT specialists. I see a lot of people like myself who would want to start a new career path and are willing to learn, but they don’t know where to start. I believe that we need more organizations like ADA Academy all over the country, so people can afford their dream. I believe that ADA will help me expand and share my knowledge with others who needs it.


###	3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

Last year a friend of mine started a company and she asked me to help her with Photoshop. I didn't know much about Photoshop back at the time and started learning immediately. 
It took me a couple of month to get some very simple things done, as I was desperately trying to collect information from all over the internet. After 2 months of struggling I finally found an online course.
And I  think it was the greatest investment ever. It also was a tremendous time saver. In just a month, I was able to do some cool tricks that I would have spent hours just looking for all over the internet.

So I discovered that while self-study is a necessity nowadays, having a teacher and structured program can save time, money, and open up new opportunities.
If I had the chance to do things differently back at that time, I would have immediately taken a Photoshop course and it would have saved me 2 months.


###	4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.
>I teach myself something new everyday. 
I am passionate to leaning and once I feel comfortable I always challenge myself with something new.

Recently I have been learning Photoshop, Lightroom, and Photography. 
Once I started learning Photoshop by myself, I always felt that I needed to talk to someone. Google is great but I missed  communicating with people who have similar interests, so I started attending Meet ups in the area and I met many incredibly smart and talented people who were also eager to learn and wanted to share their experience.

>To me learning and self-study is no longer just about myself. My motivation to learn now is the opportunity to share my knowledge with others.
